## Future Upgrades
- Alarm sound and animation made to run endlessly, stopped by a button created alarm triggering
- After setting alarm, made to change the "Set Alarm" text to "Clear Alarm" and function of button updated to clear 
- Dark Mode (with "light flashing" animation in place of shaking animation) (possibly)
